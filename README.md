### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my github page! 

You will find my work completed during the 9 weeks at the Wagon intensive bootcamp, which includes:
- ðŸ—“ The daily exercises to learn how to code
- ðŸ‘¯ Two repositories for group projects:
		- ðŸš‹ One was an airbnb-like platform to rent wagons to party (very original huh?)
		- ðŸŽµ And the other was a crowdfunding platform to invest in musicians' royalties
